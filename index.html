## Background &amp; Objectives

.med[
- Eating late/having a late dinner was found to related with higher risk of obesity, hyperglycemia, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes.

- The relationship between food choice and their time of consumption is still largely unknown.

- Identify those unhealthy foods which might be chosen during night time would be helpful. 

- To investigate and describe the relationships between **food** eaten by British adults, **time slots** and **type 2 diabetes (DM)**.

## Data Source - the NDNS RP

.med[
- NDNS RP (started from 2008): 
    - On-going cross-sectional study
    - representative of UK population &lt;br&gt; about 1000/year
    - 4 consecutive days food diary
    
- 6802 adults (age &gt;= 19 years) 
    - 2810 men and 3992 women; 
    - 749,026 recordings of food group entries.
]

---
class: middle 

## Methods and strategies

.med[
- Correspondence analysis (CA)
    - Biplots in total sample and stratified by DM status

- Generate hypotheses from (randomly selected) 50% of the food recordings then test using the other half.

- Logistic regression models using generalized estimating equation (GEE). 

- Time slots defined: &lt;br&gt; 6-9 am, 9-12 noon, 12-2 pm, 2-5 pm, 5-8 pm, &lt;br&gt; 8-10 pm and 10 pm-6 am.

- Correspondence analysis allows us to plot both the points of time and food in the same figure where here we see later time are in the upper side of the graph. And when food and time points are close together and away from the origin then it is suggested that there is an association. 

- Therefore, in the graph, food appears close to the time, means they were consumed at that time.

- It seems that later time in the day (8 pm- 10pm-) are shown on the upper side of the plot. (later time slots (8pm - 10pm, 10pm - 6am) are different from the earlier hours) 
- During morning time people are having breakfast foods (cereals/milk)

- Chocolate, Bear, Spirits, sugar candy, sweetened soft drinks are clouded around later times.

## Summary

.med[
- Foods colored in **red** for further hypotheses testing as they are considered to be relatively unhealthy and possibly being consumed differently by DM status.

- Sugar confectioneries, regular soft drinks, chocolates appear much further at the top of the figures among those with undiagnosed DM compared to the others.

# Discussion (1)


- All unhealthy foods emerged from CA were significantly more likely to be eaten after 8pm.

- These included alcoholic/sweetened beverages, chocolates and other foods rich in added sugars and saturated fats like biscuits and ice-cream.

- Foods and drinks consumed in the evening/night time tend to be highly processed and easily accessible.

# Discussion (2)

- Assessing the relationships between less healthy foods and timing of eating is a first step towards identifying specific public health targets for behaviour change/modification.

- Undiagnosed T2D patients might be at risk of causing/worsening their condition as they had higher odds to consume a number of less healthy foods after 8pm (sugar-confectionery, sweetened soft drinks).

- The survey cross-sectional nature warrants further investigations by longitudinal cohort studies.
