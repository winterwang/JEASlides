# Food group consumption and time slots

---
class: middle

## Objectives

- To investigate and describe the relationshipt between **food** eaten by British adults, **time slots** and **diabetes status**.

## Methods and strategies

- Correspodence analysis (CA)
    - Biplots stratified by diabetes status

- Mixed effect logistic regression using generalized estimating equation (GEE). 

- Generate hypotheses from half of the food recordings, and test using the other half.

- Time slots defined:  6-9 am, 9-12 noon, 12-2 pm, 2-5 pm, 5-8 pm, 8-10 pm and 10 pm-6 am.

## Summary statistics 

6802 adults (age >= 19 years), 2810 men and 3992 women from NDNS RP data (2008-2018). 749,026 recordings of food group entries.

- It seems that later time in the day (8 pm- 10pm-) are shown on the upper side of the plot. 

- Morning time people are having breakfast foods (cereals/milk)

- Chocolate, Bear, Spirits, sugar candy, sweetened soft drinks are clouded around later times.

- it is clearer that late time slots (8pm - 10pm, 10pm - 6am) are different from the earlier hours in stratified figures by food groups (for better visualisation)

# Discussion (1)


- All unhealthy foods emerged from CA were significantly more likely to be eaten after 8pm.

- These included alcoholic/sweetened beverages, chocolates and other foods rich in added sugars and saturated fats like biscuits and ice-cream.

- Food and drinks consumed in the evening/night time slot tend to be highly processed and easily accessible.

<!-- - Potentially alcoholic/sweetened beverages and foods rich in added sugars and saturated fats.  -->

<!-- - The greater odds of eating puddings in the evening might partly explain the undiagnosed/prediabetic state.  -->

class: middle 
# Discussion (2)

- Assessing the relationships between less healthy foods and timing of eating is a first step towards identifying specific public health targets for behaviour change/modification.

- Undiagnosed T2D patients might be at higher risk of causing/worsening their condition as they had higher odds to consume a number of less healthy foods after 8pm (sugar-confectionary, biscuits, sweetened soft drinks and puddings).

- The survey cross-sectional nature warrants further investigations by longitudinal cohort studies.
